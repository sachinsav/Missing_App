# Missing_Finder Android App
This is an *Android app* that communicates with the django API on my repo with the name [Missing_Finder](https://github.com/sachinsav/Missing_Finder). Anyone can find the lost (lost) person using this app. The app sends the image to the server (ie Django API) that performs face recognition and returns the result, then Android processes that result and shows the appropriate information to the user.
